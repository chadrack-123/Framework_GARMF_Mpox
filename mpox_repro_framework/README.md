# Mpox Reproducibility Framework (with GenAI hooks)

This repo focuses on **reproducible** mpox modeling:
- deterministic outbreak simulations (SEIR),
- repeatable ML experiments (fixed seeds),
- GenAI hooks for synthetic data (class imbalance) and automated docs,
- a simple score to quantify reproducibility.

You'll add code in small stepsâ€”each step is runnable and testable.
